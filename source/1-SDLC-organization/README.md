# Welcome to the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) Orgnaization CDK app

As described in root [README](../../README.md), this [CDK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/apps.html) app strive to give you a clean and easy to use set of environments (AWS Accounts) to develop and operate sofware on AWS following best practices.

## MUST READ

* This first CDK app is deploying several AWS accounts which are resources with specific contraints in regards to deletion ([Official doc](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/close-aws-account/), such as 90 days wait period). Therefore, be aware that rolling back the creation of those resources is not supported.

* Since everything is code in a repository, access and permission of to this repository needs to be carefully managed.

## Under the hood

This CDK app will instanciate the following resources:

* An [AWS Organizations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_introduction.html)
* Multiple [AWS Accounts](https://aws.amazon.com/organizations/faqs/#Organizing_AWS_accounts) under different [Organizational Unit](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_ous.html)
* A central [AWS CloudTrail for organizations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/creating-trail-organization.html)
* Few basics security guard rails using [AWS Config](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/WhatIsConfig.html)
* A DNS Zone (if a domain is provided) using [Route53 HostedZone](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/AboutHZWorkingWith.html)

Those are exposed through the **AwsOrganizationsStack**.

The deployment of this organization is automated through a CI/CD pipeline that is going to be deployed in your main account through the deployment of the **AWSBootstrapKit-LandingZone-PipelineStack**. Which enable to track any update made to it through git source control.

## Deployments

Step # | Feature | Description
-- | -- | --
0 | [Configure your local credentials](#configure-your-local-credentials) | `aws configure --profile main-admin`
1 | [Clone and init the repo](#clone-and-init-the-repo) | Get the code
2 | [Deploy the pipeline](#install-dependencies-and-deploy-the-pipeline) | Deploy your organization through a CI/CD pipeline
3 | [Setup your SSO domain](#setup-your-sso-domain) | Prepare you user permissions and groups
4 | [Setup your dev environment](#setup-your-dev-environment) | Prepare your local environment to be ready to develop
5 | [Start coding](#next-step) | Jump to next section about developing and deploying your first web site

### Prerequisites

* A [GitHub](https://github.com) account
* [npm](https://npmjs.org) and [awscli](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html) installed
* A valid email (can be your root account one) 
  * without "+" in it
  * provided by a provider supporting [subaddressing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plus_address) which means supporting '+' email extension (Most providers such as gmail/google, outlook etc. support it. If you're not sure check [this page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_webmail_providers#Features) "Address modifiers" column or send an email to yourself adding a plus extension such as `myname+test@myemaildomain.com` . if you receive it, you're good).   
* An AWS account with an IAM user with Administrator permission

### Configure your local credentials
<details>
<summary>Click to go through this step</summary>

To authenticate requests made using the CLI, we need to give your IAM user credentials (If you don't have one follow [this instruction](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_create.html) with *Programmatic access Access type* selected and *AdministratorAccess* policy) and the region you want to use to the Command line:

```sh
aws configure --profile main-admin
AWS Access Key ID [None]: AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE
AWS Secret Access Key [None]: wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY
Default region name [None]: eu-west-1
Default output format [None]: json
```

Here we use the `--profile` parameter with `main-admin` in order to, in the future be able to swtich between accounts.


You can now test our set up:

```sh
aws --profile=main-admin  sts get-caller-identity

{
    "UserId": "A1B2C3D4E5F6G7EXAMPLE",
    "Account": "111122223333",
    "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:user/Administrator"
}
```

This command show you basically what your current crendentials are attached to :
* `Account` tell you which Account Id you are talking to
* `Arn` tell you which Role you are using


To learn more, check the [official doc](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-quickstart.html#cli-configure-quickstart-config).

</details>

### Fork and init the repo

<details>
<summary>Click to go through this step</summary>

1. Fork the repository on your GitHub account by clicking [here](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-bootstrap-kit-examples/fork).

1. Clone the repository locally:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/<YOUR_GITHUB_ALIAS>/aws-bootstrap-kit-examples
    ```

1. Link your GitHub repository to AWS by 
    1. Pushing your github personal secret token (follow [this instruction](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token) if you don't have one with **admin:repo_hook** full control and **repo** full control) in AWS Secrets Manager, a service that stores your secret securely
        ```sh
        aws --profile main-admin secretsmanager create-secret --name GITHUB_TOKEN --secret-string <YOUR_GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN>
        ```
    1. Set in `source/1-SDLC-organization/cdk.json` the following variables:

        * `email` corresponding to the administrator email that will be used to create additional AWS account (without "+" character)
        * `github_alias` coresponding to your github username (`your_alias` in `https://github.com/your_alias/your_repo`)
        * `github_repo_name` corresponding to the name when you created the repository (`your_repo` in this example)
        * `gihub_repo_branch` corresponding to the main branch of your repo. (should be called `main`)
        * `pipeline_deployable_regions` corresponding to the lists of [AWS regions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-regions-availability-zones.html#concepts-regions) you plan to deploy your future applications to.
        * (optional) `domain_name` a DNS domain name to use to expose your services publicly (it needs to be already registered in a registrar such [Amazon route53](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/domain-register.html))
            it should look like:
            ```
            cd <YOUR REPO>
            cat 1-SDLC-organization/cdk.json
            {
                "app": "npx ts-node bin/sdlc-organization.ts",
                "context": {
                "@aws-cdk/core:enableStackNameDuplicates": "true",
                "aws-cdk:enableDiffNoFail": "true",
                "@aws-cdk/core:stackRelativeExports": "true",
                "@aws-cdk/core:newStyleStackSynthesis": true,
                "github_alias": "your_alias",
                "github_repo_name": "aws-bootstrap-kit-examples",
                "github_repo_branch": "main",
                "email": "admin@yourdomain.com",
                "pipeline_deployable_regions": [
                    eu-west-1,
                    eu-west-2
                ],
                "domain_name": "yourdomain.com"
                }
            }
            ```
    1. Push new changes to your repo

        ```
        git add source/1-SDLC-organization/cdk.json
        git commit -m "set required bootstrap variables"
        git push
        ```

</details>

### Install dependencies and deploy the pipeline

<details>
<summary>Click to go through this step</summary>

1. Go to the SDLC Organization folder

    ```
    cd source/1-SDLC-Organization
    ```

1. Install dependencies

    ```
    npm install
    ```

1. Bootstrap AWS account

    ```
    npm run bootstrap
    ```

1. build and deploy package

    ```
    npm run build
    npm run deploy
    ```

1. Check the status of the deployed CI/CD pipeline in AWS CodePipeline Console
(click <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/index.html" target="_blank">here</a> to learn more about AWS Code Pipeline)

1. When all green, unlock deployment to prod by approving the change to be deployed by clicking the "review" button in prod section of the pipeline.

    PS: You can inspect what is going to be deployed by clicking "Details" link of "orgStack.Prepare" action.

1. When all green, you should be able to 
    1. check your organization structure in AWS Organizations console
    1. Get into any of those sub accounts by getting the Account ID from AWS Organizations console and using the switch role button on top left drop down of the screen and the `OrganizationAccountAccessRole` Role name.

    Check the [doc](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_accounts_access.html) for more details.

</details>

**Your Operator Environment is ready! Now let's open it to the team!**

## Going further

### Finalize DNS setup

If you added `domain_name` in your config file (`cdk.json`) earlier, a last step is need to delegate your registered domain to the new hosted zone created by the previous delployment. Otherwise you can skip this section.

<details>
<summary>Click to go through this step</summary>

1. First let's get the NS servers registered in the new hosted zone by
    1. Got to [AWS Route53 Hosted Zone page](https://console.aws.amazon.com/route53/v2/hostedzones#)
    1. click on the hosted zone with 5 Record count and with the Domain name coresponding to your root domain name specified in `domain_name` earlier
    1. Copy the Value of the `NS` Type Record row of your domain name
1. Go to your registrar configuration console and replace NS servers by the one copied earlier.

**Your Done! Now you can manage your domain through AWS Route53**
</detail.>

#### Enable SSO

In order to facilitate the management of permissions on the access to this different accounts we suggest to setup an SSO portal following the steps described bellow. That's going to give you the capability to centrally manage and access your different AWS account with a single identity (login and password) or even delegate this to a third party provider such as Google Workspace (GSuite).

Staying with IAM users and groups would means not getting a central portal with a single identity and would force you to remember the different account ID and role to login into:

### Setup your SSO domain

<details>
<summary>Click to go through this step</summary>

Sorry we can't automate those step yet :cry:


1. Go to the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/home" target="_blank">AWS SSO Home page</a> and  Click *Enable AWS SSO*

#### Create permission sets

We want to be able to manage two groups of users:
* the **Administrators**  who will have access to all accounts with **AdministratorAccess** permissions
* the **Developers**  who will have access only to the Dev account with **DeveloperAccess** permissions and **ViewOnlyAccess** permissions to the Staging and Prod accounts

Through 5 set of permissions:
* **AdministratorAccess** grants administrator access to an AWS account. A user with this permission set is able to create, update or delete any resources in an AWS account including IAM users, roles and groups. It relies on the AdministratorAccess AWS managed job function policy.
* **DeveloperAccess** allows developers to create, update or delete AWS resources from an account excluding users and groups. A developer with this permission set is also able to create, delete and update roles as well as creating, updating, deleting and attaching role policies to a resource. It allows a developer to deploy a CDK app into and account directly with the cdk deploy command. It relies on the PowerUserAccess AWS managed job function policy plus a set of IAM actions.
* **DevOpsAccess**  allows DevOps engineers to deploy and manage CI/CD pipelines through CDK. It relies on 5 AWS managed policies: *AWSCloudFormationFullAcces, AWSCodeBuildAdminAccess, AWSCodePipelineFullAccess, AmazonS3FullAccess, AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryFullAccess, SecretsManagerReadWrite*. It relies on a set of IAM, KMS and Organizations actions.
* **ApproverAccess** allows users to view and approve manual changes for all pipelines. It relies on the *AWSCodePipelineApproverAccess* AWS managed policy.
* **ViewOnlyAccess** allows users to view resources and basic metadata across all AWS services. It relies on the *ViewOnlyAccess* AWS managed policy.

##### AdministratorAccess

To set up these accesses, we first need to create a permission set which correspond to the set of permissions that an Administrator will have when going to a specific account:

1. Click on the *AWS Accounts* section

1. Go to *Permission sets* tab and click *Create permission set*

1. Select *Create a custom permission set* and click *Next: Details*

1. Type in the info
    1. Name: *AdministratorAccess*
    1. Session duaration: *X hours*
    1. Check the *Attach AWS managed policies* and *Create a custom permissions policy* boxes. 
    1. Select the *AdministratorAccess* managed policy
    1. Enter the following custom permissions policy:
    
    ```{}```

1. click *Next: Tags* 

1. Skip *tags* by click *Next: Review* 

1. Click *Create* to finalize the creation of the permissions set


#####  DeveloperAccess

1. Repeat previous steps with
    1. Name: *DeveloperAccess*
    1. Manage policies: 
        * *PowerUserAccess*
    1. Custom policy:
        ```

                    ],
                    "Effect": "Allow",
                    "Resource": "*"
                }
            ]
        }
        ```

    1. Name: *DevOpsAccess*
    1. Manage policies: 
        * *AWSCloudFormationFullAccess*
        * *AWSCodeBuildAdminAccess*
        * *AWSCodePipelineFullAccess*
        * *AmazonS3FullAccess*
        * *AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryFullAccess
        * *SecretsManagerReadWrite*
    1. Custom policy:
        ```
        {
            "Version": "2012-10-17",
            "Statement": [

                        "kms:PutKeyPolicy",
                        "kms:DescribeKey",
                        "kms:CreateAlias",
                        "kms:DeleteAlias",
                        "kms:ScheduleKeyDeletion",
                        "organizations:ListAccounts"
                    ],
                    "Effect": "Allow",
                    "Resource": "*"
                },
                {
                    "Action": [
                        "sts:AssumeRole"
                    ],

                    "Resource": "arn:aws:iam::*:role/cdk*"
                }
            ]
        }
        ```

##### ApproverAccess

1. Repeat previous steps with
    1. Name: *ApproverAccess*
    1. Manage policies: 
        * *AWSCodePipelineApproverAccess*
        
    1. Custom policy:
        ```
        {}
        ```

##### ViewOnlyAccess

1. Repeat previous steps with
    1. Name: *ViewOnlyAccess*
    1. Manage policies: 
        * *ViewOnlyAccess*
        
    1. Custom policy:
        ```
        {}
        ```

You must end with the following permission sets:

* ViewOnlyAccess
* ApproverAccess
* DevOpsAccess
* DeveloperAccess
* AdministratorAccess


#### Create your groups

Now we are going to create the **Administrators**, **Developers**, **DevOpsEngineers** and **Approvers** groups, we basically will follow the steps listed in the [official documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/addgroups.html):

1. Click on the *Groups* Tab

1. Click *Create group*

1. Type **Adminstrators** as group name and click *Create*

1. Repeat steps 1 to 3 for **Developers**, **DevOpsEngineers**, **Approvers**


#### Link groups to accounts and permission sets


Now we are going to assign the **Administrators** group to all the accounts with the the **AdministratorAccess** permission set. It will result to giving *Administrator* access to users in the **Administrators** group to all your  accounts:

1. Come back to *AWS Accounts* section

1. Select all your accounts and click *Assign users*

1. Go to *Groups* tab, select *Admninistrators* group and click *Next: Permissions set*

1. Select *AdminstriatorAccess* permissions set and click *Finish* 

1. It will take a few seconds to configure all your accounts

1. When all is complete, click on *Proceed to AWS accounts*

1. Repeat 1 to 6 with **Developers**, **DevOpsEngineers** and **Approvers** groups with the following associations:

| Groups  | PermissionSets  | Accounts  |
|---|---|---|
| Developers  | DeveloperAccess  | Dev  |
| Developers  | ReadOnlyAccess  | Staging, Prod  |
| DevOpsEngineers  | DevOpsAccess  | CICD  |
| Approvers  | ApproverAccess  | CICD  |



**Now let's create your Administrator user !** 

#### Create your administrator SSO user



Now we are going to create an Administrator user, we basically will follow the steps listed in the [official documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/addusers.html):

1. Click on the *Users* section

1. Click *Add user*

1. Fill in the form with your personal data and click *Next Groups*:
    * *username* will be used for future login
    * *Email address* will be used for enrolling so need to be a valid email

1. Select the *Administrators* group created previously and click *Add user*

1. Check your email and *Accept invitation*

1. You should be redirected to a page to set your password then click *Update user*

1. Well done your account has been successfully activated! Click *Continue*

1. You have now access to your SSO app list. Click on *AWS Account* card to expand the list of accounts

1. Click on your main account to expand the list of your access to this account

1. Click on *Management console* to access to the console of your main account

1. Your are now connected with your new SSO Administrator user

**Let's assign the Developers group to Dev, Staging and Prod accounts with this new SSO Administrator user**

#### Customize your SSO endpoint

From now on, you or any of your developers won't have to login anymore directly to AWS console but directly through AWS SSO portal. In the previous step you might have noticed that your SSO console is accessible through a unique URL such as `https://d-123456789a.awsapps.com/start ` which is not that easy to remember, let's customize it to match your company domain:

1. Search for *SSO* on the console home page and go to the service

1. At the bottom of the page, click the *Customize* link located in *User portal* section

1. Type your domain name and click *Save*

**Tada !! You can now login to AWS Console through your SSO portal using your customized url !**

</details>

### Setup your dev environment

<details>
<summary>Click to go through this step</summary>

#### Create a developer SSO user

(This section is optional but will be one to use each time you want to onboard a new dev in your team)

Now we are going to create a Developer user with enough rate to develop and publish an app to the different environemnt, we basically will follow the steps listed in the [official documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/addusers.html):

1. Click on the *Users* section

1. Click *Add user*

1. Fill in the form with your personal data and click *Next Groups*:
    * *username* will be used for future login
    * *Email address* will be used for enrolling so need to be a valid email

1. Select the *Developers* groups created previously and click *Add user*

1. Check your email and *Accept invitation*

1. You should be redirected to a page to set your password then click *Update user*

1. Well done your account has been successfully activated! Click *Continue*

1. You have now access to your SSO app list with your Developer user


#### AWS CLI V2

---

**TL;DR**

Just run
```
 aws configure sso --profile dev
```

and choose 
* The previously customized URL as **SSO Start URL** with the **/start/** at the end
* your dev account in the list. 


And login with
```
aws sso login --profile dev
```

---


In order to interact with your different environment through the [awscli](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html) or any AWS SDKs locally, you will need to get your credentials.

To authenticate requests made using the CLI, we need to give the credentials generated by AWS SSO and link them to what we call `profile`. So for each environment you want to have access to through AWS CLI v2 and CDK you will have to configure a specific profile for it running the command below. 

Here we setup your first profile that will be used to replace your IAM user administrator one (`--profile dev`):

  
 ```sh
 aws configure sso --profile dev
 SSO start URL [None]: https://yourdomain.awsapps.com/start
 SSO Region [None]: eu-west-1
 Attempting to automatically open the SSO authorization page in your default browser.
 If the browser does not open or you wish to use a different device to authorize this request, open the following URL:
 
 https://device.sso.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/
 
 Then enter the code:
 
 ABCD-ABCD
 There are 5 AWS accounts available to you.
 Using the account ID 111122223333
 The only role available to you is: DeveloperAccess
 Using the role name "DeveloperAccess"
 CLI default client Region [None]: eu-west-1
 CLI default output format [None]: json
 
 To use this profile, specify the profile name using --profile, as shown:
 
 aws s3 ls --profile dev
 ```
  
 Here we use the `--profile` parameter with `dev` in order to, in the future be able to swtich between accounts.
  
  
 You can now test our set up:
  
 ```sh
 aws --profile=dev  sts get-caller-identity
  
 {
         "UserId": "A1B2C3D4E5F6G7EXAMPLE:admin",
     "Account": "111122223333",
        "Arn": "arn:aws:sts::111122223333:assumed-role/AWSReservedSSO_AdministratorAccess_1234a12345a12aa1/admin"
 }
 ```
  
 This command show you basically what your current crendentials are attached to :
 * `Account` tell you which Account Id you are talking to
